# Interactive Media Project 2

This project was created for the Course "Interactive Media Project 2" at the Anhalt University of Applied Sciences. The repository contains the code and the corresponding paper for a prototype that generates biome maps for procedurally generated landscape-like 3D meshes. This division of the terrain into biomes is highly customizable by the user and brings the potential for diverse ecosystems, which would make the generated landscapes more suitable for the use in video games or movie backgrounds.

## Previous Work

The input meshes are generated by a terrain generator software, which was implemented as part of the course ["Interactive Media Project 1"](https://github.com/mgagel/terrain-generator "Interactive Media Project 1") at the Anhalt University of Applied Sciences.

## How to use

The "IAM-Project 2" directory contains a Unity project that can be imported. By starting the runtime engine inside Unity, a standard mesh will be created and divided into biomes by default. The user can adjust different parameters of the "BiomeGenerator" component to alter the results.

## Technologies

* C#
* Unity 2021.1.7f1
* LaTeX

## Result Preview

In this section, some screenshots of the project results are displayed. The colors used are placeholders to visualize the biome dimensions. Take a look at the corresponding paper named "Marcus-Gagelmann_IAM-Projekt-2.pdf" for detailed information about the project. Currently, the paper is only available in German, though.
